3.0.8:
- Added shortcuts for importing Client classes into the adspygoogle module.
  Where you previous had to use the following import -
      from adspygoogle.adwords.AdWordsClient import AdWordsClient
  you may now do the following -
      from adspygoogle import AdWordsClient
  The same style of import works for DfaClient and DfpClient.

3.0.7:
- Patched MessageHandler's PackForSoappy function to no longer treat strings and
  unicode strings the same way.

3.0.6:
- Added a patch to MessageHandler's _RestoreListTypesForResponse function. It
  will now check any returned object for a field ending with ".Type" and use
  this field as the class name when restoring list types.

3.0.5:
- Added support for SSL certificate verification through the Client's "ca_certs"
  property. Please see our README.Common file for instructions.
- Added support for HTTP message compression with SOAPpy.
- Added "compress" property to the Client which can set HTTP compression on/off.
- Updated SOAPpy patch to version 1.0.4. This fixes issue 8.

3.0.4:
- Updated SOAPpy patch to version 1.0.3. This fixes issue 13.

3.0.3:
- Modified GenericApiService to treat SOAP parameter element names as string
  types rather than unicode types. These element names are used as keyword
  argument keys and the ability to use unicode keys in keyword arguments only
  exists in Python 2.6.5+. This fixes issue 9.

3.0.2:
- Updated the SOAPpy.patch file to version 1.0.1. Added an explicit __str__
  function to SOAPpy.Client.__Method to prevent odd behavior when the str()
  function was called on an object of this class. This addresses issue 6.

3.0.1:
- Modified MessageHandler to not pack items that evaluate to False into SOAP
  requests.

3.0.0:
- Removed support for ZSI.
- Added patched version of SOAPpy as sole supported SOAP toolkit.
- Removed ApiService and WebService classes in favor of joint GenericApiService
  class.

2.2.1:
- Addressing AdWords issue 164 (cannot use super with Exception in Python 2.4).

2.2.0:
- SOAPpy will now transform xsd:dateTime and xsd:float values into strings
  before returning them from a SOAP response. Previously, they were returned as
  6-item tuples and floats, respectively.

2.1.0:
- Altering the way ZSI handles elements that are not present in the response.
  Moving forward, if an object is not present (i.e. ZSI stores None in the
  generated class's field), we will no longer include it in the dictionary
  returned from an API call.  Previously, it would include the field as a key
  with '' (empty string) as the value.

2.0.0:
- Added scripts to generate pickled dictionaries representing the WSDL.
- Added the ability to validate types against the WSDL.
- Added ZSI Transformation layer to automatically turn python objects into ZSI-
  compatible form.
- Reworked SanityCheck and SOAPpy MessageHandler to take advantage of the WSDL
  definitions.

1.1.7:
- Added support for complex SOAP headers.

1.1.6:
- Update Utils.GetUniqueName() to support name length. Reverted how construction
  of the unique name is done to make it more random for names with shorter
  length.

1.1.5:
- Added Utils.GetDictFromCsvFile() method.
- Patch to pack NoneTypes as 'xsi3:nil="true"' in SOAPpy
- Patch for allowing use of data injecting with SOAPpy regardless of whether a
  service uses WSSE or JAXB.

1.1.4:
- Patch for BaseException.message deprecation warning in Python 2.6.
- Patch for recognizing _xmlplus in SoapBuffer.

1.1.3:
- Patch to escape special HTML characters for all values in SOAPpy.

1.1.2:
- Patched handling of the local paths on Windows in Utils.GetDataFromCsvFile()
  (Fixes issue 136).
- Patched support for properly setting xml_parser in Client.__SetXmlParser().
- Patched support for ETREE, when ZSI is used (Fixes issue 132).

1.1.1:
- Reworked Utils.GetDataFromCsvFile() to support CSVs located remotely.
- Patched SoapBuffer.py to check on the right values for XML parsing
  modules (Fixes issue 131).

1.1.0:
- Added support for HTTP proxy in AuthToken (Fixes issue 122).

1.0.3:
- Patch for parsing/injecting SOAP XML messages in "SoapBuffer.py", catches
  NoneType.
- Added Utils.GetDictFromMap() method.

1.0.2:
- Patch for Utils.HtmlEscape().

1.0.1:
- Patch to support WSSE headers.
- Mask for 'Password' header.
- Added support to handle SOAPpy's ArrayType.
- Updated PackDictAsXml() in adspygoogle.common.soappy to be less restrictive.

1.0.0:
- Initial release.
- Added support for raw debug.
- Added support for sending and recieving compressed data when ZSI is in use
  (Fixes issue 102).
- Added automatic way of loading error types.
- Improved the way fault object is generated.
