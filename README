AdWords and DoubleClick Ad Exchange Buyer API Python Client Library
===================================================================

Google's AdWords and DoubleClick Ad Exchange API service lets developers design
computer programs that interact directly with the AdWords and DoubleClick Ad
Exchange platform. With these applications, advertisers and third parties can
more efficiently -- and creatively -- manage their large or complex AdWords and
DoubleClick Ad Exchange accounts and campaigns.

AdWords and DoubleClick Ad Exchange API Python Client Library makes it easier to
write Python clients to programmatically access AdWords and DoubleClick Ad
Exchange accounts. One of the main features of this client library is that it
hides SOAP layer from end user, which makes it much easier to interact with API.
The outgoing and incoming SOAP messages are monitored and logged on demand. The
response headers like responseTime, units, requestId, etc. can also be logged on
demand. Another nice feature of this client library is that it handles data
types for all API call parameters. All variables are passed in as either dict,
list, or str. The conversion to the right type is handled internally by the
client library. Each client instance keeps track of its own number of API units
and operations consumed during the program run.

Starting with 15.0.0, the client library uses a patched version of the SOAPpy
web services toolkit from http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net/, which is included
in the tarball download. This change allows us to write more consistent and
maintainable code, including unit tests and code examples.

This change also includes fixes to make SOAPpy follow the WSDL when returning
objects. For example, when an element is defined in the WSDL with maxOccurs > 1,
this is traditionally represented as a list (SOAPpy would return back a list of
elements when more than one element is present in the response). However, when
only a single element is returned in the response, SOAPpy used to return back
just the element, not the element wrapped in a list. Starting with 15.0.0, it
will correctly return back a list with a single element.

Multiple modules are supported for parsing SOAP XML messages. By default, the
client library uses the PyXML module in order to parse SOAP XML messages. In
addition, the SOAPpy library supports ElementTree module, which may be activated
simply by setting the appropriate config value (i.e. config['xml_parser']).
Also, if you have Python v2.5+, the ElementTree comes with it. The cElementTree
module is now also supported.

The code examples, located in "examples/", demonstrate how to use the client
library. For additional examples, take a look at the unit tests in "tests/".

Useful scripts are located in "scripts/" directory.

The documentation was generated using Epydoc, a nice tool for generating API
documentation for Python modules, and is located in "docs/".

The client library includes a set of unit tests located in "tests/". All unit
tests are (and should be) executed against the Sandbox environment. Whenever
changes are made to the client library, the appropriate unit test should be
executed to make sure that everything is working as intended and no new bugs
were introduced.


How do I start?
---------------

Start by making sure that you have Python installed on your machine. If you
don't have one already, sign up for a Google Account at
https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount. Once that's taken care of, proceed
to the step-by-step guide below. Write some code and enjoy!


Step-by-step guide for accessing the sandbox:
-----------------------------------------

1) Make sure you have Python v2.4 or above installed. The latest stable version
   can be fetched from http://www.python.org/.

2) If using PyXML, fetch the latest version of PyXML module from
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyxml/.

3) Sign up for a Google Account. In later steps, we'll assume that the new login
   is joe.shmoe@gmail.com.

4) Navigate to the directory that contains your downloaded unzipped client
   library and run the "setup.py" script to install the "adspygoogle.adwords"
   module.

   $ python setup.py build install

5) From the same directory, run the "config.py" script to set authentication
   headers. More information about the format of each header is
   at http://code.google.com/apis/adwords/docs/developer/adwords_api_sandbox.html#requestheaders.
   Example,

   Your AdWords account's login email: joe.shmoe@gmail.com
   Login password: secret
   Login client customer id:
   User agent: GoogleTest
   Developer token: joe.shmoe@gmail.com++USD

   Select XML parser [1=PyXML, 2=ElementTree]: 1
   Enable debugging mode [y/n]: n
   Enable SOAP XML logging mode [y/n]: y
   Enable API request logging mode [y/n]: y

6) Run "examples/adspygoogle/adwords/VERSION/basic_operations/get_campaigns.py",
   which will set up your Sandbox with five client accounts. Please note that
   starting with v201109 you must use a clientCustomerId (you can run the script
   again to update the value). We have provided a code example to translate
   between them:
   "examples/adspygoogle/adwords/VERSION/basic_operations/get_client_customer_id.py"

7) Read over the documentation in "docs/index.html" to familiarize yourself with
   the API of the client library.
